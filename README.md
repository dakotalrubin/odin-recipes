# odin-recipes
A basic web site for food recipes written in HTML.  
  
This web site, written for The Odin Project, tests my understanding of  
basic HTML concepts. The site's home page will use relative paths to link  
between different locally-stored pages, which contain unordered lists of  
ingredients and ordered lists for cooking directions. Embedded images  
will populate each page to add visual flair. Recipes and images sourced  
from Allrecipes.
